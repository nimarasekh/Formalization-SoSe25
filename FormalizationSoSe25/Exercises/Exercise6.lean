In the `Lecture6.lean` we defined `Group‚ÇÑ` as a particular group structure.
-/
#check Group‚ÇÑ

-- Here is a different group structure.
class Group‚ÇÖ (G : Type*) extends Monoid‚ÇÅ G, Inv‚ÇÅ G where
  inv_dia : ‚àÄ a : G, a‚Åª¬π ‚ãÑ a = ùüô

export Group‚ÇÖ (inv_dia)

/-
We want to see that although `Group‚ÇÖ` seems weaker than `Group‚ÇÑ`, we can actually
recover the original definition.
-/


/-
Let's start with the easy case.
Show that every `Group‚ÇÑ` gives us a `Group‚ÇÖ`.
Here you probably want to use `Group‚ÇÖ.mk`.
-/

#check Group‚ÇÖ.mk
def group4_to_group5 {G : Type*} [Group‚ÇÑ G] : Group‚ÇÖ G :=
  Group‚ÇÖ.mk (Group‚ÇÑ.inv_dia)


/-
Now, we also go the other way around.
This requires some lemmas.

These two lemmas should be provable using only:
- `rw`
- `exact`
- `have`
and the structure of `Monoid‚ÇÅ` and `Group‚ÇÖ`.
-/


lemma equal_inverses {M : Type*} [Monoid‚ÇÅ M] {a b c : M} (hba : b ‚ãÑ a = ùüô) (hac : a ‚ãÑ c = ùüô) : b = c := by
  sorry


lemma dia_inv' {G: Type*} [Group‚ÇÖ G] (a : G) : a ‚ãÑ a‚Åª¬π = ùüô := by
  sorry

/-
Now, use this last lemma to go from `Group‚ÇÖ` to `Group‚ÇÑ`.
Here you probably want to use `Group‚ÇÑ.mk`.
-/
def group5_to_group4 {G : Type*} [Group‚ÇÖ G] : Group‚ÇÑ G := sorry

/-
Let us end this by observing that the two constructions are inverse to each other.
-/
lemma group4_to_group5_to_group4 {G : Type*} [h : Group‚ÇÑ G] : @group5_to_group4 G (@group4_to_group5 G h) = h  := by
 sorry

lemma group5_to_group4_to_group5 {G : Type*} [h : Group‚ÇÖ G] : @group4_to_group5 G (@group5_to_group4 G h) = h  := by
  sorry

Let us now try to make new structures.
We go step by step.

First we define a new structure `LE‚ÇÅ` that defines a relation on a type `Œ±`.
-/

class LE‚ÇÅ (Œ± : Type*) where
  /-- The Less-or-Equal relation. -/
  le : Œ± ‚Üí Œ± ‚Üí Prop

@[inherit_doc] infix:50 " ‚â§‚ÇÅ " => LE‚ÇÅ.le

/-
Your job is now to slowly define and extend from here:

Recall a preorder is a relation on a type that is reflexive and transitive.
- Reflexivity means that for all `a`, `a ‚â§ a`.
- Transitivity means that for all `a`, `b`, `c`, if `a ‚â§ b` and `b ‚â§ c` then `a ‚â§ c`.

Define a class called `Preorder‚ÇÅ` that extends `LE‚ÇÅ` with these two properties.
They should be named and have the following docstrings:
- `refl` should have the docstring "The reflexivity property."
- `trans` should have the docstring "The transitivity property."

/-
A partial order is a preorder with the additional property of antisymmetry.
- Antisymmetry means that for all `a`, `b`, if `a ‚â§ b` and `b ‚â§ a` then `a = b`.

Define a class called `PartialOrder‚ÇÅ` that extends `Preorder‚ÇÅ` with this property.
It should be named `antisymm` and have the docstring "The antisymmetry property.".
-/

/-
We now bring in some algebraic structure.
We have already defined `Monoid‚ÇÅ` in the lecture.
-/

#check Monoid‚ÇÅ

/-
A commutative monoid is a monoid with the additional property of commutativity.
- Commutativity means that for all `a`, `b`, `a ‚ãÑ b = b ‚ãÑ a`.

Define a class called `CommMonoid‚ÇÅ` that extends `Monoid‚ÇÅ` with this property.
It should be named `dia_comm` and have the docstring "Diamond is commutative."
-/

/- DELETE THIS FILL ANSWER HERE-/

/-
We now combine the two structures into one.
An ordered commutative monoid is a structure that is a
commutative monoid and also a partial order, with the following property:
- For all `a`, `b`, `c`, if `a ‚â§ b` then `a ‚ãÑ c ‚â§ b ‚ãÑ c`.
This means that the multiplication is compatible with the order.

Define a class called `OrderedCommMonoid‚ÇÅ` that extends `PartialOrder‚ÇÅ` and `CommMonoid‚ÇÅ`
 with this property. It should be named `le_mul_left‚ÇÅ` and have the docstring
"The multiplication is compatible with the order."

The class `OrderedCommMonoid‚ÇÅ` has many new properties.
`export` all of them.

/-
Now we want to prove some about ordered commutative monoids.

Write a lemma called `le_mul_right‚ÇÅ` that states
- for all `a`, `b`, `c`, if `a ‚â§‚ÇÅ b` then `c ‚ãÑ a ‚â§‚ÇÅ c ‚ãÑ b`.

Here:
- There should be an implicit type `Œ±` in `Type*`.
- `OrderedCommMonoid‚ÇÅ` should be a typeclass.
- `a`, `b`, `c` should be of type `Œ±` and also implicit.
- There should only be an explicit hypothesis named `h` that `a ‚â§‚ÇÅ b`.

Now prove it!
Again, this should be provable using only `rw`, `apply` and `exact`,
and the properties of `OrderedCommMonoid‚ÇÅ`.

Finally, let us get an instance of a `OrderedCommMonoid‚ÇÅ`.
We will use the natural numbers.

Here we call some basic facts about inequalities for natural numbers.
-/
#check 0
#check 2 ‚â§ 3
#check le_refl
#check le_trans
#check le_antisymm
#check Nat.add
#check Nat.add_comm
#check Nat.add_assoc
#check Nat.add_zero
#check Nat.zero_add
#check Nat.add_le_add_right

/-
We now have the following structure of `OrderedCommMonoid‚ÇÅ`.

Uncomment the next line if you have solved the previous exercises.-/
