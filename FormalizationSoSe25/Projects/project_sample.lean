/- This section defines a product between subsets of X×X (for X some set) as well as an operation for taking inverses
  and the diagonal set as a neutral element. These will be needed in order to define coarse spaces.

Nima: Why is this definition not just the identity? Note this also works:

  def SetInv {X : Type*} (sub : Set (X × X)) : Set (X × X) := by

    exact sub ⟨ e2, e1 ⟩

  def SetDiag (X : Type*) : Set (X×X) := {⟨x,x⟩| x : X }

/- Now we define the class CoarseSpace analogously to a Topology. A coarse space consists of a set X and a coarse structure
ε ⊆ P(X×X) ("controlled sets"), where ε is closed under union, inverse and product as well as contains the diagonal.-/

class CoarseSpace (X : Type*) where
  IsControlled : Set (X × X) → Prop
  IsControlled_union : ∀ s t : Set (X × X), IsControlled s → IsControlled t → IsControlled (s ∪ t)
  IsControlled_diag : Set (X×X) := SetDiag X
  IsControlled_inv : ∀ s : Set (X×X), IsControlled s → IsControlled (SetInv s)
  IsControlled_prod : ∀ s t : Set (X × X), IsControlled s → IsControlled t → IsControlled (SetProd s t)



/- In the following, we want to establish that every MetricSpace is coarse by showing that an arbitrary
MetricSpace is an instance of a CoarseSpace. This holds, if we define s ⊆ X×X controlled ↔ diam(s) := sup{d(x,y)| (x,y) ∈ S} < ∞.
We start with a section for auxiliary lemmas and definitions.
